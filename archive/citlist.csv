Name Done Notes
Design Twitter X
maps, User should have linked list of tweets, get feed similar
to merge k sorted lists
Alien Dict (Page 1) X Topo Sort, Use the words to get graph
Best time to buy/sell stock (k times, 2 times ) (Page 1) X DP + Variable for counter, State: (index, cap, isBuy)
median of 2 sorted arrays (Page 1) X Binary search, partition both arrays, if odd more elem on left
k smallest elements (Page 2) X nth_element in stl
N Queens (Page 1) X
Backtraking by row, checking is impl heavy can be done in
one loop
2 sum problem with doubles (X) X Use epsilon/brute force 1e-9
Sort the list with the order of encountering X
different ways to add parentheses X Split on Operator eval(first), eval(rest) then combine
Longest matching parenthesis (Page 1)
traversing a matrix in a spiral X Right, Down, Left, Up, repeat
jump game
rotate array X 3x Reverse
word search X DFS
min stack X
2 stacks one for data, one for mins, push/pop on min after
comparing values
expression add operators
longest increasing path X DFS + DP, Can be solved with topo sort
merge intervals X Sort By start, prev.end >= curr.start then merge
overlapping intervals X Equiv to schedule max meetings (sort by finish time)
least frequently used cache X
Map of freq -> LRU Cache, keep track of min freq, Map key -
> Node pointer/ittr
autocompleter
circular buffer X Keep track of L/R or Head and count
Skyline X
Sort points, use multiset, add new point on height change,
multiset like pq
Find cycle in graph X Union Find (better) can be DFS / Topo sort for directed
2812. Find the Safest Path in a Grid X Use BFS to preprocess them dijkstras or BSF + binary search
union of 2 lists ?
Search in Rotated Sorted Array REDO
Rotting Oranges X BFS, Keep track of fresh and max time
Trap rainwater X
 water(i) = min(max_left, max_right) - hi. O(N) space using
prefix/suffix, O(1) space using 2 pointer
https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/ X
Edge case when matrix is just one row/rect. Add check for top
<= bottom, and left <= right. in last 2 loops

Find closest palindrome X
If single digit return n - 1. Otherwise there are 5 cases all 9s,
1(0)*1, prefix-1, prefix, prefix + 1 return the closest
Buy Sell stock cool down X Same as buy sell stock II but skip a day if sell
move 0s to front of array X Pointer to last 0, swap at non-zero and increment pointer
Thread pool X
mutex + Queue/pq for tasks. Atomic Stop variable for
stopping, CV for waiting on queue or stop variable. Vector to
store threads
point lies inside a triangle
String class with big 5
virtual inheritance X
big endian/little endian
Merge k sorted lists X
min priority queue to keep head pointers to all lists. Push top
of heap to merge
Insert Delete Get Random X Map from value => index, move to back for O(1) remove
